> Hello there üëã,My name is Four or Flow nick @6ix4

> I'm a student and a web developer,I help authors of open source projects ,I'm a member of the HackClub community and
> work with non-profit organizations for my passion.

This is a project my personal website. It's a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world. It's also a
place
where I can experiment with new technologies and techniques.And now I make a React website and use some techniques to
make animation from PNG pictures.
## Inspiration üå±
A few day ago, I was looking for a new project to work on. I wanted to build something that would be fun to work on and
would allow me to learn something new.I go to join a hackathon.And that was the way for me to join the HackClub
community,and after
that I study friends' many projects of many friends, and I found [this website](https://www.dinosaurbbq.org/) { Author [Max Wofford](https://github.com/maxwofford) }
accidentally,That's so cool! I want to make a website like this and confident that I can do it.But why I never do it
because I don't have creative ideas like this,which is really sad.üòÖ
But! I don't want to plagiarize all of it, so I decided to make a website with some tricks and techniques that I'm
learning. I'm learning this technique to someday I can build a simple web game.That's a technique
called [Sprite Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b7FyIxWW94&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iHDnQfTHEVVceOEBsOf07i&index=1)
, and I think it's really cool, if I put all inspiration into my personal website.

A lot of people have asked me, why made this complicated website? For just .gif or mp4 to make it easier? I think it's a
little start on my path to build a web game,I hope you like it.üòÅ And I'm sorry if my English is not good enough.
